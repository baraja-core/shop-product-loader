Shop product loader
===================

Idea
----

The aim of this package is to provide a general interface for communication with other parts of the e-shop and to pass on available products.

The main service `HeurekaProductLoader` (a child of the `ProductLoader` interface) provides all active unsold products that can be passed on to the XML feed.
